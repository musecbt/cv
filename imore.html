<h1>What is Muse?</h1>
<p>    Muse stands for &quot;medically unexplained symptoms expertise.&quot;  Muse clinicians work with patients who are experiencing bothersome physical symptoms that persist after medical diagnosis and treatment. For many of our patients, these unresolved, uncomfortable symptoms result in serious health concerns and anxiety that can impair the quality of our patients' lives. </p>
  <p>If this sounds like you, Muse can help. If your health concerns and bodily symptoms are interfering with your relationships with other people, impacting your ability to concentrate on work, keeping you from participating in activities you used to enjoy, or otherwise negatively impacting your life, this program can help you regain control and confidence.</p>
  <h1>    How does Muse work?</h1>
  <p>    Muse is a <strong>free</strong> treatment program, customized around your needs and symptoms and conveniently delivered to you in the comfort of your own home.  Our unique program consists of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>    A specially trained Muse clinician will listen carefully to your symptoms and medical concerns</li>
    <li>    Your clinician will develop a tailored treatment plan, which will last 8-10 sessions</li>
    <li>    Each week, you'll have a one-on-one 50-minute treatment session with your clinician via secure video call</li>
    <li>    Your clinician will teach you proven techniques for coping with your condition, which you will implement and experiment with in between sessions</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How can the Muse treatment program help me?</h3>
  <p>    The Muse program provides you with tools to help you actively take control of your symptoms and health concerns. You will learn new ways of thinking, behaving and reacting that will improve your experience of illness and help you gain a sense of well being.  Through Muse, you will learn strategies for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>    Reducing the volume of your symptoms so they become less bothersome and distressing</li>
    <li>    Decreasing your health concerns and worries </li>
    <li>    Eliminating the disability and impairment that results from your symptoms and concerns</li>
    <li>    Turning your attention to more enjoyable and satisfying things than your symptoms and anxiety</li>
    <li>    More adaptive ways to cope with the stresses that can make you feel sick</li>
    <li>    New ways to think about your condition and the causes of your symptoms</li>
    <li>    New approaches to your medical care and relationship with doctors</li>
    <li>    …and more</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>I have real medical symptoms—how it is possible that this will help?</h3>
  <p>    Just because symptoms are severe and bothersome doesn't mean that a serious disease is the cause. In fact, it rarely means that. </p>
  <p>    It is possible to have intense and distressing symptoms without having a serious disease.  We call them &quot;functional” symptoms—meaning that they are caused by a physical dysfunction, rather than by an anatomical or biochemical disease. For example, many people have severe back pain or headaches, but doctors can't find anything abnormal in their blood tests or on their x-rays.</p>
  <p>    People with functional conditions are often very sensitive to, and very aware of, what's going on inside of their body. For example, you may notice moments of dizziness, a twitching eyelid, night sweats, or a bout of hoarseness. </p>
  <p>    Most of the time, you tolerate these uncomfortable sensations because they don't seem significant. However, as they persist, you may begin to suspect that they are being caused by a serious illness or disease. </p>
  <p>    When this occurs, our natural inclination is to worry about them, concentrate on them and research them. While this is a totally normal reaction, it can produce significant anxiety and often result in the symptoms getting worse.</p>
  <p>{Diagram]</p>
  <p>Muse clinicians are specially trained to teach patients new ways of interacting with their symptoms, in order to break this vicious cycle and allow their functional conditions to get better. Over time, you will learn to strengthen your body's natural tendency to heal. </p>
  <h3>    What's the science behind the Muse program? </h3>
  <p>    Muse is based on a cognitive-behavioral approach to the treatment of medically unexplained symptoms. It is based on over 30 years of research by scientists in leading medical schools and has been scientifically proven to help patients reduce the effect that bodily symptoms have on their life. </p>
  <h3>    Who are the Muse clinicians?</h3>
  <p>    Muse clinicians are PhD level psychologists who specialize in pain disorders, medically unexplained symptoms treatment and health psychology. </p>
  <h3>    Should I continue seeing my regular doctor?</h3>
  <p>    Muse is not intended as a replacement for your current medical care—it is designed to complement your doctor's treatment. You will remain under your doctor's care and will need to discuss continued treatment with him or her.<br>
  In tandem with your doctor's care, working with a Muse clinician will help you learn to better manage your symptoms and reduce the negative impact of your symptoms and the anxiety they cause. </p>
