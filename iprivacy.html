  <h3> <a name="Use_of_cookies" id="Use_of_cookies"></a>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>
  <p> We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you. </p>
  <p> <em>Cookies</em>. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site, in order to help us to process your online transactions and requests, verify your identity, and track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but will not be able to login or participate in the Services.</p>
  <p> <em>Local Storage Objects.</em> We may use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”), such as Flash LSOs, to store your Site preferences, display video and to personalize your visit. LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. </p>
  <p> <em>Clear GIFs.</em> Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs, in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors and App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>
  <p> <em>Third Party Analytics and Tracking.</em> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences, not to track users across our Site and third party sites. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties. </p>
  <h3> User Generated Content</h3>
  <p> We may invite you to post content on our Site, including your comments, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Site.  If you post content to public areas of our Site, this information may be viewable by other users of our Site.  YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE NOT TO POST ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD NOT WANT ANOTHER PERSON TO KNOW.  If you post your own content on our Site or Services, Muse cannot prevent such information from being by others used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.</p>
  <h3> Third-Party Links</h3>
  <p> Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>
  <h3> Security of My Personal Information </h3>
  <p> We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.  You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
  <h3> Access To My Personal Information</h3>
  <p> You may modify the profile information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain in our systems and also be viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site. </p>
  <h3> Communications</h3>
  <p> We may send transactional or informational emails to you, but we will not send you marketing or promotional emails unless we have your authorization.</p>
  <h3> Children Under 13</h3>
  <p> Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.</p>
